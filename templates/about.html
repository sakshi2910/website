    <h3>
    Welcome to Giggles Playway! The <b>mission</b> of our School is to provide a traditional early childhood program. We strive to help each child develop socially, emotionally, physically and intellectually and to fulfil his/her potential in a structured yet nurturing environment. We are committed to maintaining a healthy balance between a non-competitive, supportive environment and a challenging experience through which children develop a strong sense of values and a positive image of themselves and of education in general. Our students are encouraged to be curious, independent and responsible, and to enjoy learning. <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/><br><br>
  "Giggles Playway" was established in Lucknow in 2006 by Mrs. Shipra Sharma. The goal was to offer a developmentally appropriate early childhood program for children in the neighborhood. The School was established as an autonomous, non-denominational institution with an independent, self-perpetuating administration. Its purpose then, as now, was to give young children the best possible preparation for their ongoing education and for life.</h3>
